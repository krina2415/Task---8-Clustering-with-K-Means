# Task---8-Clustering-with-K-Means
# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates how to use K-Means clustering for customer segmentation based on age, annual income, and spending score. PCA is used for 2D visualization of clusters.

## Files

- Mall-Customers.csv: Raw dataset used for clustering.
- Task 8-Clustering with K-Means.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the full clustering.

## Steps Performed

1. Loaded and visualized dataset.
2. Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction.
3. Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
4. Applied K-Means clustering and visualized results.
5. Evaluated the clustering using Silhouette Score.
